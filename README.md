# File Encryption and Decryption Tool

This C++ program provides a simple utility to encrypt and decrypt files using the XOR cipher technique. It allows users to specify a single-character key for the encryption and decryption processes.

## Features

- **Encrypt and Decrypt Files**: Easily encrypt or decrypt files using a character-based key.
- **File Handling**: Supports reading and writing files in binary mode, making it suitable for various file types.
- **User Input**: Simple command-line interface for user input.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- C++ Standard Library (included with most compilers).

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program**:
   Use the following command to compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o file_cipher file_cipher.cpp
